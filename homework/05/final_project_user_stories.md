# BEWD Final Project
## User Stories
Create a file called `user_stories.txt` and add at least 5 user stories to document the ways in which users will interact with your webapp. If your application has different types of users, ensure that you describe at least 2 user stories for each type of user. See the resources in [the wiki](https://github.com/ga-students/BEWD_2_HK/wiki) to learn about user stories.
