## Resources: Models & Active Record

###Cheat Sheet

####Create Models

```bash
  rails g model ModelName attribute_name:migration_type attribute_2:migration_type
```
* Use spaces to separate attributes. If you don't list a migration_type (text, integer, float, etc.) the default will be string.

####Migrations

__Migrations__

* Forgot an attribute / field in your model? Create a migration
  * Code below adds a field called ratings to the Movies model.

```
  rails g migration AddRatingToMovies rating:integer
```

__Seed Files__

* Populating an entire database with the console would take a while. Use the seeds.rb file.

```
rake db:seed
```

__Drop The Database__

* _You will loose your data if you do this._

```
  rake db:drop
```

__Drop database, run migrations, run seeds__

```
  rake db:reset
```

####Active Record

__Create__

  ```
    Movie.create(title: "Jaws")
  ```

__Read__

  ```
    Movie.find_by title: "Jaws"
  ```

  ```
    # Returns all movie objects in an array.
    Movie.all
  ```

__Update__

  ```
    jaws = Movie.find_by title: "Jaws"
    jaws.update description: "Big Shark, bites people"
  ```

__Delete__

  ```
    jaws.destroy
  ```


###Still Feel Lost?

At the end of this course you should have an understanding of what databases are and the general structure of a database table (rows and colums). In addition you should be familiar with how to create, update and delete records using active record in the Rails console.
