# Part 1: Working with Arrays and Hashes
#
# 1. Copy your solution from conditional_teddit.rb.
# 2. Create an empty stories array. This will be used to hold all stories we capture.
# 3. Users enter the story as they do now, but it gets put in a hash instead.
# 4. Update any reference to the story (upvotes, category and title)
# 5. Your story hash should look like the one below:
#   { title: "Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace", category: "Teeth", upvotes: 1 }
# 6. Add the hash to an array called stories and print "Story: Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace, Category: (Teeth), Current Upvotes: 1"
# 7. Using the stories array, test your cat, bacon, and food upvote conditional logic.
#
# Part 2: Adding Loops
# 1. Use a loop so that your program continues to ask a user for stories until they choose to quit. ("Would you like to add another story? Enter 'y' or 'n'")
# 2. Once the user is finished with entering their stories, use .each to print each story in the stories array.
