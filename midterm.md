# Back-End Web Development
## MIDTERM REQUIREMENTS
### Due **Sunday 23 November 2014**

Create a command line application that fulfills these criteria:
* Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. you expect numbers and you get a letter).
* Connects to a 3rd-party API where the call varies based on what the user gives you.
* Must be object oriented. You must instantiate modeled classes. The only file that can run without classes is your runner.
* Submitted via GitHub.

## GRADING
Your midterm is considered complete if it meets all the requirements above. Your instructor will provide you with feedback.
