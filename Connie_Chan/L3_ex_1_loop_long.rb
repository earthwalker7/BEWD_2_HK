# Write a program that prints 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
# The song starts with
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall
# 99 bottles of beer!
# You take one down and pass it around,
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall!
#
# And ends with
# 1 bottle of beer on the wall
# 1 bottle of beer!
# You take one down and pass it around,
# No more bottles of beer on the wall :-(
